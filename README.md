# Adaptive-and-Fault-Tolerant-Flight-Control-Systems

## Synopsis

For flight control systems, this paper proposes an adaptive control approach based on a framework of Explicit Model Following Direct Adaptive Control scheme. As a first step, a modified F-16 dynamics model is developed to explore control surface redundancies, as well as to enable modelling of dynamics changes result from faults, failures and/or plant deviations. In this modified model, each control surface can be individually controlled. Next, this paper proposes a flight control framework that integrates an Adaptive Neural Network, non-linear dynamic inversion, control allocation, System Identification with Uncested Kalman Filter and Model Reference Following scheme to leverage their synergies. Then, the proposed approach is tested using the F-16 nonlinear model developed and its performance is validated via numerical simulations.

## Motivation

Current linear Flight Control Systems (FCS) algorithms are incapable of adapting to sudden changes in terms of aircraft configuration. It is well known that classical control approaches only provide a satisfying performance and robustness if the aircraft is close enough to the model assumed for control design. Any uncertainties or failures lead to degradations in stability and performance. Therefore, linear, model-based control techniques might require complete redesign of control if there are significant changes in aircraft configuration. As a result this tends to restrict the ability to alter the design or carry new equipment or to handle in-flight reconfigurations.

## Requirements
